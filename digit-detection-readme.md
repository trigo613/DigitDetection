## Step 1: Load the Digit Data
In this step, we load the digit dataset that contains images of digits along with their labels.

## Step 3: Load Images from Google Maps
Images are obtained from Google Maps, which will serve as the backdrop for our digit placement.

## Step 4: Randomly Place the Digits in a Cropped Image
This step involves randomly placing the digit images onto a cropped version of the Google Maps images.

## Step 5: Draw a Bounding Box on the Digit
We then draw bounding boxes around the digits that have been randomly placed in the images.

## Step 8: Non-Max Suppression
Finally, we apply non-max suppression to filter out overlapping bounding boxes, ensuring we retain only the most accurate detections.
